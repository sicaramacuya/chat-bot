# Insisting Chat Bot
This program consist of two parts. A chat bot and a simple mini-game. The chat bot is called Lyra and she is petty persistance.

## Lyra
Her job is just convince the user to play the mini-game. She can get anoying some times but it doesn't matter if at the end the user plays the game. She has responses that can pick from and she will pick them at random. To add a little bit of more realism if if that not the first round of the user playing the list of responses Lyra will pick from are going to be different.

## Mini-game
A really simple obstacle course. The idea is that if the obstacle is low enough the user will want to jump it. In the other hand, if the user can't jump over the obstacle he will need to duck it. The fun part is that the game will keep track of the time the user is insided the obstacle course and at the end will display it.
